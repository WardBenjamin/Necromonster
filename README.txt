A 2D topdown 2x RPG.

Pretty much it's one of those whole the kindom is experiencing dark times things in medieval times.
A bunch of monsters are attacking people in the towns and no one really knows why.
Everyone looks to the court wizard to explain things, but he can't. As things get progressivley worse, tensions build and the court wizard is banished for being a fraud.
He wanders the the land until he comes accross a really old decrpid tower (stone).
Since night is coming, he decides to hide away for the night in the tower.
Inside he finds a <insert magic item>
that lets him control a monster. He also finds a chest, old bed, and a map.
Having no better place to stay, he decides to stay here and try to earn his role in the kingdom back by defeating the monster source.
Pretty much the main game mechanic is that you control a monster which goes into dungeons and gets loot for you.
The monster levels like you'd expect, but when it dies, it's a permadeath.
The wizard goes on to summon more monsters, who bring back loot that make him stronger.
They level up and get armor and stuff, but if they die, they're never coming back.
In the day, you go to the nearby town and advance that plot by doing quests for people.
The dungeon exploring plot and the daytime plot are linked, so you can't move too far forward in one without moving farther in the other.
